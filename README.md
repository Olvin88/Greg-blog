  <h2>My First Coding Experience</h2>
    <h3><em>(a.k.a. When I Thought I’d Build Instagram in a Week)</em></h3>
<p>
The whole <strong><em>"i want to be a programmer"</em></strong> idea started last year, around December. I didn’t even know what kind of programmer I wanted to be — I just wanted to be one. It sounded powerful, like I’d suddenly start talking to computers and building cool stuff out of some <em>weird, random symbols.</em>
</p>
  <p>
So in <strong>January</strong>, I picked up <strong>Python</strong>. I heard it could do everything: <em>ethical hacking, game development, AI, machine learning</em> — basically the superhero of programming languages. The guy who told me that really sold the dream.
  </p>
    <p>
<strong>Reality said otherwise.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
I started learning on my own, thinking I’d be running the tech world by March. Instead, I barely understood anything. The only thing I could proudly type was:
    </p>
    <p>
print(f"Hello, World!")
    </p>
    <p>
That line became my entire career for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
Most days, Python just cooked my brain. I’d watch tutorials, try examples, and end up closing my laptop like, “yeah, maybe next week.” Sometimes “next week” actually meant next month.
    </p>
    <p>
Then one day, a small drop of wisdom hit me: maybe I should start with something simpler. Something I could actually see working. That’s how I found <strong>web development</strong>.
</p>
    <p>
When I started with <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, everything just made sense. I made my first website mock — it wasn’t <em>functional</em>, but it looked decent, and honestly, that was enough <strong>motivation</strong> to make me believe <em>I’d build Instagram by next week</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
Then <em>JavaScript entered the chat, to define patience</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
That’s when I truly understood what patience means. It’s like <em>HTML and CSS</em> handed me <strong>confidence</strong>, and <em>JavaScript</em> <strong>snatched it</strong> right back.
    </p>
    <p>
But hey, <strong><em>I’m still here, still learning, still breaking things (on purpose, mostly).</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
If there’s one thing I’ve figured out from all this, it’s that programming isn’t about being perfect — it’s <em>about <strong>surviving the confusion long enough to actually learn something.</strong></em>
